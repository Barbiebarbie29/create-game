# Create Phaser Game

One of the easiest ways to get started quickly with [Phaser](https://phaser.io) is by using our `create-phaser-game` app. This is a CLI tool that presents a selection of official project templates and demo games, allowing you to get started quickly with everything set up for you.

You can pick from any of the following templates:

| Frameworks | Bundlers |
| --------- | ------- |
| Vue.js | Vite |
| React | Rollup |
| Angular | Parcel |
| Next.js | Webpack |
| SolidJS | ESBuild |
| Svelte | Import Map |

Most of these come in both JavaScript and TypeScript versions, and the tool will present this option to you when available.

## How to use

To create a new local game template interactively, use one of the following terminal commands:

```
> npm create @phaserjs/game@latest
```
```
> npx @phaserjs/create-game@latest
```

```
> yarn create @phaserjs/game
```

```
> pnpm create @phaserjs/game@latest
```

```
> bunx create @phaserjs/game@latest
```

If you would like to pass the project/folder name and skip this step of the tool, you can do so on as a parameter to the create command:

```
> npm create @phaserjs/game@latest folder-name
```

The tool will then ask you a series of questions to allow you to configure your game template.

Once installed you can modify the template settings and check its own `README.md` file for further instructions.
