This is a tool that helps you install the available Phaser templates.

We have the following templates available:

- angular
- esbuild
- esbuild-ts
- importmap
- nextjs
- parcel
- parcel-ts
- react
- react-ts
- rollup
- rollup-ts

## How to use

To create a new game template, you can use the following command:
```
> npm create @phaserjs/game@latest
```

If you want to create a new folder with the game template, you can use the following command:
```
> npm create @phaserjs/game@latest folder-name
```

Next you will be asked a series of questions to configure your game template.

Once you install the template, you will be able to read the template's settings in its own readme.md file.
